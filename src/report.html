    <h2>How We Met the Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We used the Git repository created by the professor and committed regularly.</li>
        <li>TODO site deployed on each students' stu?</li>
        <li>
            We use media queries for responsive design.
            Responsive layout styles using media queries for small/large screens can be found in our CSS file to switch between rows and columns depending on screen size.
        </li>

        <li>The main page includes multiple forms (in modals) that lets users select data types and time ranges.</li>
